vertex - nodes
edges - connection b/t nodes

undirected graphs - all edges/connections are two way (Facebook)
directed graphs - could be single direction for edges (Instagram)

weighted graph - edges have value (magnitude)
unweighted graph - edges don't have value

google maps - weighted, directed graphs


adjacency list 
+ can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
+ faster to iterate over all edges
- can be slower to lookup specific edge (possible N)

adjacency matrix
- takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
- slower to iterate over all edges
+ faster to lookup specific edge (Constant)
